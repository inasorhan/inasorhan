Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.

Choosing the right location for your small business
Small businesses are vital to our economy and society, but they can be difficult to manage on a budget. Here are some tips for choosing the best location for your small business. 
1. Consider your business size: A small business needs a space that is large enough to accommodate all of its employees and equipment, but not so large that it becomes difficult to operate. 
2. Consider your location: Your business should be located in a city or town that has a plentiful population and infrastructure, as well as good cultural amenities. 
3. Consider your expenses: You may want to consider the cost of living in your area before making a decision about where to set up shop. 
4.Consider the climate: If you plan on operating in cold or hot climates, make sure you have appropriate insurance and planning for cooling off times when necessary.
