How can you come up with big ideas?
There are a few things you can do to come up with big ideas. The first is to think about what you want to accomplish. Once you have an idea of what it is that you want, the next step is to come up with a plan for achieving it. You can use whatever methods work for you, but some tips on coming up with big ideas:
1. Make a list of everything that needs to be done in order to achieve your goal. This will help you identify any possible obstacles that may stand in your way and help create a roadmap for success.

2. Come up with specific examples of how your goal can be accomplished using common methods and resources. This will give you a deep understanding of what is required and make the process easier.

How to start a blog?
If you're looking for ways to start a blog, here are some ideas to get you started. First, consider what kind of content you'd like to create. If you want to share thoughts on your work or politics, then your blog would be focused around that topic. If you want to write about life in general, maybe something like “How I Found My Love for Painting” might be more interesting. Once you have a focus, though, there are a few things to keep in mind when starting a blog. First, make sure your blog is easy to navigate and find. You don't want people trying to find your site by accident while they're browsing the internet; make sure your site is well-marked and easy to navigate. Second, make sure your content is high quality. No one wants to read an article that's full of errors or sparse information.
