Is creativity necessary for success?
Creativity is not always necessary for success, but it can certainly play a role. In some cases, creativity can be helpful in coming up with new ideas or strategies. However, in others, creativity may not be the best choice. For example, if you are looking to succeed as a business owner, then you need to be able to come up with innovative and effective plans. However, if you want to be creative and come up with new ideas on your own behalf, then it might not be the best choice.
