Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
