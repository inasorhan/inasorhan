The Benefits of Innovation: What are the benefits for businesses and individuals?
New technologies, such as those that allow businesses to make changes in their products or services without having to go through traditional marketing or product development processes, are often associated with benefits for the business and individual stakeholder groups alike. These new technologies can provide businesses with new markets and customers, faster turnaround times for products or services, increased efficiency and productivity, and new opportunities for innovation. In some cases, these advantages can even lead to competitive advantages over older rivals.
While there are a number of benefits associated with innovation (including creating jobs and boost the economy), it can also have negative effects on businesses if not managed properly. For example, when a company begins using a new technology incorrectly or does not properly validate its results before implementing them in the marketplace, it can result in negative publicity and decreased sales.

What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, thatâ€™s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.
