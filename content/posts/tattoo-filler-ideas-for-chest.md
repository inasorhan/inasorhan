The study showed that the number of new ideas is higher than ever before and this has negative consequences for both businesses and society. The study suggests that businesses should focus on developing old ideas instead of creating new ones, and society should focus on preserving the quality of ideas instead of allowing them to be replaced by more common ones.

Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesn’t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!

Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
