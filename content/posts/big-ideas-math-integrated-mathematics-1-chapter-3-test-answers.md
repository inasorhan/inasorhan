Patenting an invention: What is the process?
Patenting an invention can be a complex process, but there are key steps that are typically followed. Inventors typically create a patent application, which is then submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO will review the application and decide whether to issue a patent or not. If the USPTO decides to issue a patent, the inventor must then file a full U.S. Patent Act lawsuit against someone who has already registered their trade mark or copyrighted their invention.

The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.
