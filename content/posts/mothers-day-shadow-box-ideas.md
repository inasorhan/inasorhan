The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.

Innovation: How can you make your inventions more successful?
Inventions can be a great way to make your business more successful. By coming up with new ways to do things, you can make your products or services more affordable and accessible, or even create new markets for them. Here are four tips for making your inventions more successful:
1. Think about what customers want. When you come up with an invention, think about the needs that your target market might have. What are the products or services that you could offer that would meet those needs?
