What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.
