Patent applications: How do you apply for a patent?
When you come up with an invention, the easiest way to protect it is to apply for a patent. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In order to be considered for a patent, your invention must meet certain requirements, including: 
-Your invention must be new and not using copyrighted material
-Your invention must be on a subject that is currently being used in commerce or in the development of a product
-Your invention must have a clear and novel idea that can be patented
-Your Invention should be based on an existing product or service There are several ways to file for a patent, but many people start by submitting their idea to a competition or through their professional Labs. The USPTO has many resources available online so you can get started.
