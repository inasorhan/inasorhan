Work is currently the foundation of society. It allows people to earn a living and provide for their families. However, as technology continues to advance, it is clear that work will need to change in order to accommodate the needs of an all-out robotic apocalypse.

Conclusion: The benefits and mistakes of brainstroming
There are many benefits to brainstroming, but also some potential pitfalls. One important thing to keep in mind is that the process should be used sparingly and only when it feels like a relevant solution is available. Another thing to consider is that brainstroming can be addictive, so use it carefully – or avoid it altogether if you’re feeling overwhelmed.
