Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.

The process of invention:
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that can be used in a business or other activity. It can take many different forms, but the basic process is the same: you come up with a solution to a problem and then create a prototype to see if it works.
Invention is an important part of any business, and it can help make things easier for people who are working hard to get things done. It also allows companies to keep their products and services fresh, and it makes it easier for people to find what they need when they need it.
