How to keep your home clean and organized:
Keeping your home clean is not only easy but can also be fun. There are a variety of ways to keep your home clean, and some are easier than others. Here are two diy ideas that can help keep your home clean and organized:
1. Add a cleaning supplies organizer to the wall near the sink. This will help you see what supplies need to be cleaned and which ones can wait until later.
2. Make a list of all your family’s food allergies and grocery store favorites in a grocery-store-provided bag or container. This will make it easier for you to know what items need to be picked up from the store and which ones can wait until later.
