The different types of ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everything. They give people a way to think about problems and come up with solutions. It can be difficult to come up with ideas, but with some effort, anyone can create something new. There are many different types of ideas, but here are four that are particularly useful for business:
1. Problem-solving: When you have a problem, you need to come up with a solution. One of the best ways to do this is by thinking about the problem and coming up with ideas on how to solve it. You might come up with a plan or an idea on how to solve it, or you might just have some creative neurons firing and come up with an amazing solution!

2. Innovation: When you’re looking for new ideas, it’s important to think outside the box.

Overcoming blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are things you can do to overcome this block.
First, try to relax. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay if you can't think of anything right now. It happens to everyone. Just take a break for a few minutes and come back later.

If relaxation doesn't work, try brainstorming. Write down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and developing them further.

If all else fails, talk to someone else about your project. Sometimes it helps to hear someone else's perspective on what you're trying to write about. They might have some good ideas that you can use.
