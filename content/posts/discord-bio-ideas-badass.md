What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clich√©s. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clich√©s and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven‚Äôt been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!

Summary: What are some things to remember when trying to be creative?
Creativity is a good thing, but it doesn't mean you have to be creative all the time. There are some things you can do to help make your creativity more effective. Here are some tips:
1. Try to find a subject that you feel passionate about. This will help get your creative juices flowing and give you ideas for projects that are specifically tailored to that subject matter.

2. experiment with different mediums and techniques. Don't be afraid to try new things, even if they don't work out immediately. You'll get better at creating with variety in mind.

3. make time for yourself each day. If you're not able to create during your normal hours, invest in time tomorrow that will allow you to be creative at night or during other times when you're free from distractions.
