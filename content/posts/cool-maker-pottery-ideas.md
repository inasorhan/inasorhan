There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today: 
-Virtual Reality: This could be used for training or for real-world applications such as medical surgery. It's already being used in games and allows users to feel as if they are within the game or the application itself.
