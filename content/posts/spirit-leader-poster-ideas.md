What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of change that occurs in any business or organization. Innovation can be defined as the ability to create new and better ways to do something. Innovation can also include the addition of new ideas, products, services, or even business models. Every business has room for growth and innovation if done correctly. However, there are some steps businesses must take in order to achieve success with innovation.
One important step in achieving success with innovation is understanding your customers. You need to understand what they want and how you can provide it to them. Once you know this, you can begin developing innovative ideas that will help your customers achieve their goals.

Another step businesses must take is creating a positive customer feedback loop.

How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.

Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.
