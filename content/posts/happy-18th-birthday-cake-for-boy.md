What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

What is customer service and how do you provide it?
Customer service is a term that is often used interchangeably with customer relations. It refers to the various methods through which customers can interact with companies and receive the service they need. From calling in for a repair to speaking with a supervisor, there are many ways to get help from your company.
There are two main types of customer service: face-to-face and online. Face-to-face customer service allows customers to interact with employees directly. Online customer service is more common, but it can also be accessed from computers or devices. This type of customer service provides a variety of options for customers, including webinars, chat rooms, and social media platforms.

Both types of customer service have their own strengths and weaknesses.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are always something to think about and consider as you go about your day-to-day life. Whether it’s coming up with a new idea for a product or service, or thinking of ways to make your business more efficient, big ideas are always important to consider. Here are some of the most popular big ideas around these days:
1. Start your own business: This is an option that many people take on because they feel like they don’t have a lot of options available to them. The cost of starting your own business can be low, and there are many resources available online if you need help getting started. There is also the added benefit of not having anyone else telling you what to do.
