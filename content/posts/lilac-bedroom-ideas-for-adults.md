How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

What are the benefits of using ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. By using them, you can improve your thinking process and come up with new ideas that may be more effective than the ones you’ve been using before. Here are six benefits of using ideas: 
1. More efficient thought: When you have a lot of ideas to think about, it becomes easier to come up with good solutions. This makes problem solving more efficient and faster, which is important for any business or project. 
2. More creativity: Ideas are often more creative than what you’ve been used to before. This is because they deal with new solutions and possibilities rather than just following the same path someone else has already taken. 
3. Easier communication: Ideas help to breaking down complex topics and making them easier for others to understand.
