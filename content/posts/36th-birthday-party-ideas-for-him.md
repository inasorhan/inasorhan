Elements of creativity: What are the elements of creativity?
Creativity is a term used to describe the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can be found in everything from art to business. There are a few key elements that make creativity work, and they revolves around brainstorming and problem-solving. Here are four:
1. Brainstorming: Brainstorming is the process of coming up with ideas for solving a problem. It requires both thinking outside the box and being willing to experiment.

2. Problem-solving: When it comes to creativity, there’s no one right way to do it – it depends on what you want your product or service to achieve. The key is finding a way to solve the challenge your customer or client is facing.

History of Invention: From prehistoric times to the present day
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think and do things. From prehistoric times, there was evidence of people trying to come up with new ideas and inventions. Inventions have helped us achieve many things, from making everyday items more efficient and easier to creating new technologies that have made life more difficult for enemies or even our own countries.
