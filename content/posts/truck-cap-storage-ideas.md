1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.

Cut down on expenses: How do you save money on your everyday items?
When it comes to spending money, most people tend to do things the same way over and over again. That is, they try to save money by doing everything they can. However, if you want to save money on your everyday items, there are a few ways you can do this. One way is to cut down on your expenses by making small changes in your behavior. For example, rather than spending $5 on a movie ticket every time you go out with friends, spend $3 or $2 instead. Another way of saving money is by shopping at thrift stores or sale areas. There are usually sales going on all the time at these places so you can get good deals on your everyday items.
