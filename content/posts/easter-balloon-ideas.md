The creation process: How a person goes from inspiration to finished product
When someone starts creating art, they are likely inspired by something that has caught their eye. This might be a picture, a scene from a movie, or something they see in their everyday life. The process of becoming finished product is often like the journey of getting inspiration from somewhere else. The artist must first determine what they want to create and then go through the creative process of coming up with ideas and putting those ideas into a form that can be seen and touched.
