Planning: How do you plan out your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are an important part of any creative plan, but it can be hard to come up with them. 
There are a few things you can do to help get started:

1. Come up with a rough idea of what you want to create. This will help you focus on the most important aspects of your project and make sure your ideas are well-explored. 
2. Look at other creative projects and see how theyâ€™ve planned out their ideas. This will give you some ideas for how you could approach your own project. 
3. Create a list of possible ideas and research which ones are best suited for your project. This will help ensure that your ideas are well thought-out and have potential for success.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are always a good thing, especially when they can help improve someone's day-to-day life. Here are some of the best ideas around: 
1. Make a list of what you need in order to start painting or sculpting. This will give you a starting point for creating something that you're passionate about and can work on for hours. 
2. Draw inspiration from other cultures and their art styles. This can help you to create pieces that are unique and interesting. 
3. Take a walk outside and take in the atmosphere. This can provide you with many different ideas for art projects that you may not have considered before. 
4. Use technology to your advantage! If you have an Instagram or Facebook account, start postulating creative ways to use it in your artwork instead of just letting it be an eyesore.
