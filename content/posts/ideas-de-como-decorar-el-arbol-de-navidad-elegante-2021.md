What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.

Some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique:
When it comes to problem solving, one of the most important techniques is brainstroming. Brainstroming is a process of using your thoughts and ideas to brainstorm solutions to problems. It’s a great way to come up with potential solutions and get started on solving a problem. However, there are some common problems that can be caused by poor problem solving technique. Here are five examples:
1) You don’t have enough time: Brainstroming is supposed to be a process that takes around 20 minutes. If you’re trying to solve a problem that’s taking longer than that, you may not have enough time left to come up with solutions.

2) You don’t know what you’re looking for: WhenBrainstroming, you need to be specific about what you want to come up with.
