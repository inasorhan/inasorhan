The Invention Process: Describe the steps involved in coming up with an invention idea.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By following a few simple steps, you can turn your idea into a reality.
The first step is to come up with an idea. This can be anything that you think would make life easier or more fun. Once you have an idea, the next step is to do some research. See if anyone has already invented what you're thinking of, and if so, how you can improve upon it.

After doing your research, the next step is to develop a prototype. This is a working model of your invention that you can use to test how well it works and make any necessary improvements. Once you're satisfied with your prototype, the final step is to patent your invention and start mass-producing it for the world to enjoy!

The benefits of big ideas: How do they benefit society as a whole?
Big Ideas offer a way to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can improve society as a whole. There are many benefits to big ideas, both private and public. Here are three of the most common: 
1) They inspire people to think about how they can improve their community and themselves. Big Ideas encourage people to question why things are the way they are and look for ways to make their world a better place. This can lead to change, both in the individual and community levels.

2) They help us confront problems we might not have seen before. Big Ideas give us new perspectives on how to solve problems and bring about change. This can be exciting because it allows us to see solutions that we might not have considered before.

The Origin of Invention: How did Invention come about?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as dreamt up in your head, or something more complex like developing a new product or technique. Inventions often come about when people come up with an idea that others may find valuable. Some inventions, such as the printing press, were developed for the purpose of helping people make money. Other inventions, such as the lightbulb, were created simply to make things better.
