Find a passion: What makes you happy?
Are you sick of being stuck in the same routine? Do you want to start living your life with a sense of purpose and meaning? If so, there are a few passions that could help you find happiness. Here are six reasons why you should start exploring interests outside of your comfort zone: 
1. You can be creative. There is no need to be afraid to experiment and try something new if you have a passion for life. You can explore all sorts of hobbies, art styles, and career paths that could make you happy. 
2. You can learn things. A passion for learning can be a great way to find happiness because it gives you something to focus on other than yourself. Learning about new topics or people can give you insight into your own personality and identity that can make you happier. 
3. You can connect with others.
