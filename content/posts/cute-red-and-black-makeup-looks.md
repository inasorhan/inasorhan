4) Transform transportation infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure is important for both people and businesses. It includes roads, bridges, airports, and other areas that allow people to move around and businesses to run their operations. But as the world moves increasingly towards electric vehicles and other forms of transportation that don't use gasoline or oil, the need for transportation infrastructure will only become more important. 
One way to improve the transportation infrastructure is to create more efficient ways to generate energy. Another way to improve it is to consider how people can be better connected with one another while they are on their way to or from work or school. 

There are a number of ideas that could be put into place in order to improve transportation infrastructure.

How can we make our ideas into actual products or services?
In business, big ideas are the life blood of startups. They can turn into successful products or services with a bit of effort and creativity. But how do you make your big ideas into reality? Here are three tips:
1) Get help from a marketer: A good marketer can help you identify potential customers and convert them into paying customers.

2) Take your time: Start with small, achievable goals first and then move on to more ambitious ones as you get closer to your target market.

3) Be creative: Be open to new ideas and don't be afraid to experiment. If you can come up with an effective way to solve a problem or reach a new audience, your idea will be more likely to succeed than if you try something that's already been done before.

Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

What makes big ideas great?
Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.
