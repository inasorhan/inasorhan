Big Ideas: 1. Big ideas are key to success in any field.
2. You can't have big ideas if you don't have ambition and a willingness to learn.
3. There are many ways to develop big ideas, but the best way is to keep exploring them and trying new things.
4. If you're not constantly trying new things, you'll eventually plateau and lose your idea content.
5. It's important to be willing to experiment with your ideas, because the more you try, the better chance you'll find something that works for you and your business.
