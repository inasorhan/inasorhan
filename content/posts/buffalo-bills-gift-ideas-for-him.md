The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.

Innovation: What is it, and how can it be used?
Invention Ideas

There are many ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most common ways is through innovation. Innovation can be a result of anything that can make life better or easier, from improving on existing technologies to coming up with a new way of doing something. Inventors often come up with innovative ideas when they're stuck and need to come up with something that works or that's easier to do.

One of the best things about innovation is that it can help solve problems. Not all inventions are created equal, and there are different types of patents and trademarks that are used in the business world. Patenting an invention allows others to use your idea for free, so you can make more money off of it while still being able to keep some control over your work. trademarks are another way to get other people's attention and help promote your invention.
