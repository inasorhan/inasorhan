Conclusion: What are some successful inventions?
Inventions are often the products of individuals who come up with an idea for a new product or service, and then go on to make it a reality. Some famous inventions include the transistor, the Apollo 11 moon landing, and the iPhone. The list goes on and on, but it is important to think about what made some of these inventions successful – from the innovative design to the marketing that helped them sell out. Here are six examples of successful inventions that you may have never heard of:
1. The television set: George Martin invented Television in 1928 and introduced it into homes across Great Britain in 1930. The TV set has become one of the most popular devices in history, with over 150 million units sold worldwide.

2. Laser pointer: Sheldon Whitehead developed Laser pointers in 1958 and they became very popular among students and other members of the public.

Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.

What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected changes in thinking or behavior. It can be a result of a single event, such as seeing a new person or experiencing an unusual situation, or it can be more general and persistent.

There are several possible explanations for why brainstroming might occur. One theory is that the brain is working harder than usual to process information. Another theory suggests that the brain is using different strategies to solve problems, which has led to some unexpected changes in thinking. Still another theory suggests that the brain is trying too hard to understand something and isn't getting enough rest. Whatever the reason,brainstroming can lead to some surprising changes in thought and behavior.
