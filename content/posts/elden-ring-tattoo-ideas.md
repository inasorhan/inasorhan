The Differences between Creative Art and Reality Art: There are a few different types of creative art, but they all have one common goal – to inspire.
Creative art is all about inspiring people to think differently. Reality art, on the other hand, is all about reality. They may have different goals, but they both aim to promote an accurate representation of the world around them. Here are some key differences between creative and reality art: 
1) Creative artists often use their own imagination to create pieces that are unique and inspiring. Reality artists often rely on real-world objects or events to create their work. 
2) Creative artists often use more color and light than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on shadows and reflections for their work. 
3) Creative artists often use more movement than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on stills and images to create their pieces.
