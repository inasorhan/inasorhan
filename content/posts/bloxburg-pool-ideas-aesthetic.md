Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative art is a process that involves the thinker, artist, and audience in order to create something new. The creative process starts with the idea and then the artist must come up with a way to make it a reality.

The creative process
When it comes to the creative process, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be open-minded and willing to experiment. Secondly, don’t be afraid to take risks – creativity often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone. And finally, trust your instincts; if something feels right, go with it.
Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creativity; what works for one person may not work for another. But keeping these general principles in mind can help you tap into your own creativity and come up with new and innovative ideas.
