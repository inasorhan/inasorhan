The power of collaboration:
When it comes to creative ideas, two heads are better than one. That’s the power of collaboration.
Working with someone else can help you come up with ideas you never would have thought of on your own. And it can also make the process more fun. But how do you find the right collaborator?

First, look for someone who has complementary skills to yours. If you’re a big-picture thinker, team up with someone who’s good at details. If you’re more of a doer, find someone who’s good at generating ideas.

Second, make sure you have similar goals and values. You want to be on the same page from the start so there are no surprises down the road.

Finally, trust your gut. Go with your instinct when it comes to choosing a collaborator.
