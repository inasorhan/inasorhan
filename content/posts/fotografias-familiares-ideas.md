How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.
