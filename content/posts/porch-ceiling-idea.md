The educational process of creativity: How does it happen?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts, is an important part of any successful artist. However, the process of creativity can vary depending on how someone is educated. Some people learn how to be creative through art classes or Leroy Sizemore’s The Creative Process. Others learn it through reading or watching creative minds work. Regardless of how someone learns to be creative, the end goal is the same-to come up with new ideas and concepts that can help them in their artwork and business endeavors.
