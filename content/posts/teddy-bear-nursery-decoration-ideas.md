Invention Ideas are the stuff of legends and myths. What lies beneath their surface? For some, Invention Ideas may be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that revolutionizes how people live. However, for others, Invention Ideas may be something much more complex and amazing.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.
