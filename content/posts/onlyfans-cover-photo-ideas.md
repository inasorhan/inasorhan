Patenting: How do inventions work?
Patenting is the process of claiming a new invention as your own. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can take anywhere from one to six months to be granted. Once granted, your invention can be used to protect it from others who may want to make a similar product or service.

The definition of creative art and how it has no limits
Creative art has no definitive answer or meaning. It is art that is created from the imagination, emotions, and thoughts of an artist. It can be anything that the artist wants it to be, and there are no limits on what can be considered creative art.
Some people may say that creative art is only valid if it is created with a certain purpose or meaning in mind, but that is not the case. The beauty of creative art is that it can be whatever the artist wants it to be, and there are no rules or boundaries that need to be followed.

The sky's the limit when it comes to creative art, and that's what makes it so special. Anyone can create something beautiful and unique, regardless of their skill level or experience.
