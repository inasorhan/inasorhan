How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved. You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.

What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas in the world, but what makes a good idea? This question is difficult to answer, as there is no one right answer. However, some tips on how to make an idea into a successful business venture can help. 1) Start with a small goal: What are your main goals for the business? Once you have a solid goal, it is easier to develop a plan and execute on it. 2) Be realistic: Don’t expect your business to be anything great right away. First, focus on making money and expanding your reach. 3) Keep things simple: When you start developing your idea, don’t overcomplicate things too much. 4) Be patient: Take your time in developing your business idea and don’t rush things.
