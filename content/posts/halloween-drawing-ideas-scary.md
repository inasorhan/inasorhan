Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful. The process of innovation involves four distinct stages: ideation, development, commercialization, and scaling. Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.
Organizations that innovate successfully tend to have a few key attributes in common. They are open to new ideas, willing to take risks, and have a culture that supports creativity and experimentation. They also have a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and how they can be met in new ways.

 Innovation is essential for businesses to thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace. But it’s not enough to simply have good ideas – they must be executed well in order to create lasting value.

Invention life cycle: From idea to market debut
Invention life cycle is a process that starts with the idea and ends with the product in people's hands. The process begins with brainstorming, which is where ideas are shared and discussed. Next, there’s developing the idea, which can involve researching and coming up with proofs of concept. Once the idea is developed, it needs to be tested and validated to see if it can be turned into a reality. Lastly, there’s marketing and distribution to let people know about the product.
