The Future of Innovation: What challenges will we face as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work?
One of the challenges facing humanity as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work is that there is no one definitive answer to how innovation should be approached. Some argue for a more open-minded approach, in which innovation is seen as a tool that can be used for good, while others suggest that any new technology or approach should be tested and refined before it is put into widespread use. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure: There will always be people who argue for change, even when it comes to how we approach innovation.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
