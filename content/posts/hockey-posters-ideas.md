Online brainstorming: the power of the virtual brainstorm
1. Brainstorming is a process that helps us generate new ideas and solutions to problems.
2. It is a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex problems and come up with innovative solutions.
3. Brainstorming can be done alone or in groups, and it can be done online or offline.
4. Online brainstorming has many advantages over offline brainstorming, such as the ability to connect with people from all over the world, the ability to share ideas instantaneously, and the ability to get feedback quickly.
5. Offline brainstorming has its own advantages, such as the ability to focus more deeply on one's own thoughts, the opportunity to build relationships with team members, and the chance to brainstorm in person.

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?
