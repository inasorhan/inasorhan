The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.
