Creativity is a term that has been around for centuries and means different things to different people. In its broadest sense, creativity refers to the ability of people to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can also refer to the state of mind in which an individual is in when they are creative. The definition of creativity also varies from person to person, so it’s important to define what creativity actually means for us all. It could mean different things depending on our individual backgrounds, experiences, and goals.
