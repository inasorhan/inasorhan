How to implement Innovation in Your Business
Innovation is not a new concept to business. However, implementing it in a successful business can be quite the challenge. Here are four tips to help you get started: 
1. Think about what you want your business to be known for. What does your target market want to know about you? How can your innovation help them achieve this? 
2. Try using multiple channels of communication. Not all communications are equal – some are more effective than others. You may need to experiment with different methods before finding the one that works best for your business. 
3. Be willing to risk failure. When starting something new, there’s always a chance it won’t work out – especially if you don’t have experience or know how to do it well.
