Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.
