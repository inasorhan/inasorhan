How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.

defines what invention ideas are
The definition of an invention idea is up to the inventor. 
There are many different ways to create and patented inventions, so it is important to determine what type of invention you are thinking of creating. There are four main types of inventions: 
1) Product: A product is a physical object that a customer buys or uses. This could be anything from a new appliance to a new car. 
2) Process: This could be anything from baking soda to driving in rain. Inventions that improve or change the way products are made are often called process patents. 
3) Service: Service patents cover ideas that improve the service industry, such as making it easier for customers to find information or resolving problems faster. 
4) Technology: This could include anything from computers to air travel.
