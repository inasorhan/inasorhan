Creativity is something that everyone has in them. Whether it's coming up with new ideas for a project, or just coming up with new ways to see things, creativity is always a good thing. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1) Use color to bring life to your designs. Add a splash of color to any design and it will look more interesting and realistic.

3) Take risks and experiment with new technologies. When you're working on a project, it's important not to be afraid of making mistakes. risked experimenting with new technologies can lead to better results than simply following conventional wisdom.
