Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from regularity?
Creativity is the ability of a person to come up with new and innovative ways to do something. It can be defined in many different ways, but in general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. This varies from person to person, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a definition. However, some key definitions of creativity include: • Artistry: The quality or practice of producing creative works • Innovation: Coming up with anew or novel solutions to problems or challenges • Creativity Loop: A continually evolving process that leads to new ideas and results 
What makes creativity so special? One major factor is that it doesn't always have a standard definition. Unlike regularity, creativity doesn't just involve coming up with new things- it can also involve coming up with ideas that are impossible to accomplish by any other means.

How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.
