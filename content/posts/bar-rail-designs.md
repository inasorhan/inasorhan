What makes big ideas great?
Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.

The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:
1. Category: What is your idea in question? This will determine its feasibility and whether it can be turned into a successful product or service.
2. Concept: How well does your idea align with the category you have chosen? If it's a new take on an old product, for example, then you'll need to come up with a concept that makes sense within the category being explored. And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?
