What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be found in everything from fashion design to science fiction writing. In spite of its many forms, creativity is often thought of as a single-minded pursuit. But that's not always accurate. Creative art can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their skill level or creativity levels.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?

Business models: What are some innovative business models?
Invention ideas can be anything from a new product to a new business model. Here are some of the most innovative business models in the world:

Datacollection has become increasingly important in todayâ€™s economy, as more and more companies need to know how their customers are interacting with them.

3. The crowdfunding industry: This model takes advantage of the generosity of people who want to support a project but donâ€™t have enough money available to do so.
