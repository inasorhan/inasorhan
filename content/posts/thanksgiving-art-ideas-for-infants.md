How can brainstroming be used in your business?
Do you want to know how you can use brainstroming in your business? If yes, read on. Brainstroming is a powerful tool that can help you understand your customer and find new areas of growth for your business. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Legitimate brainstroming should start with understanding what your customers want and need. This information should be gathered through customer surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Once you have this information, you can begin exploring different areas of customer needs and desires.

2. Use brainstroming to reach out to customers who have not interacted with you before. Reach out to customers who may be interested in what you have to offer but haven’t had the opportunity to speak with you yet. This will help increase brand awareness and build trust between yourself and your customers.
