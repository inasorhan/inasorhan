How can we bring these ideas to life?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They give a direction, a potential solution, and a reason to keep going. By coming up with big ideas, you can inspire your team and yourself to continue trying new things even when things feel threatening or difficult. Here are eight ways to bring big ideas to life:
1. Come up with an idea that’s outside the box: There’s no shame in being original, but many startups focus on what others are doing instead of coming up with their own concepts or solutions. If you don’t have anything similar in mind, you can always consider using popular trends or phrases as your starting point.

2. Take on a challenge: When it comes time to come up with a concept or solution, sometimes challenges are what help foster creativity and innovation.
