Overcoming the obstacles to thinking big
Big ideas can be difficult to come by, but they are the foundation of any great idea collection. If you are working on your own idea collection, there are a few things to keep in mind. The first is to make sure your idea is big enough to warrant taking the time to develop it further. Secondly, be willing to take risks and fail if you don’t believe in your idea. Finally, do not hesitate to reach out for help if you need guidance or support. These three tips can help you overcome any obstacle that stands in your way of developing big ideas.

So, if you have an idea for a new product, make sure it is something people will want and need. There are many ways to come up with an invention, so don't be afraid to experiment.

Bringing Your Invention to Market: Tips on how to get your invention into the hands of consumers.
Inventing something is only half the battle. The other half is getting it out there in front of consumers. Here are a few tips on how to get your invention into the hands of people who will use it.
1. Do your research. Make sure your invention is novel and has a marketable purpose. There's no point in trying to sell something that no one wants or needs.

2. Develop a prototype. This will help you to not only test your invention, but also show it to potential manufacturers, retailers, or investors.

3. Get a patent. This will give you legal protection and help you to commercialize your invention by licensing it to others.

4. Market your invention.

How do you make your blog stand out from the rest?
There are a few things you can do to make your blog stand out from the rest. Here are some ideas: 
1. Use a unique tagline. This will help people know where they can find your blog, and it will also help you attract more traffic.

2. Make your blog content interesting and helpful. People want to read helpful, informative posts, not just those that are empty calories or boring information dumps.

3. Be funny and entertaining. Blogging is a fun hobby, so make sure your content is both enjoyable and informative too!

4. Be original. When other bloggers start using the same template or style for their blogs, it becomes difficult for them to stand out from the crowd. So be unique and think outside the box!
