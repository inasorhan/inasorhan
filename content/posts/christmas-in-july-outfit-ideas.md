Invention's Definition: How invention works
Invention is a process by which something new and unknown is developed. Invention can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition seems to be that it is the creation of something new, whether it is an invention of a new product or a new way of doing something. Inventors are often creative minds who come up with ideas for products or methods that would never have been considered before.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
