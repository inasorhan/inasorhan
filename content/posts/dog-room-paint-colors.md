What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.
