Trends in mobility: How will new transportation systems make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks?
In the coming years, new transportation systems are going to make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks. One of the most significant changes will be the growth of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing platforms allow people to borrow a car from someone else, and then use it to drive around town or go to different places. This type of transportation system is becoming more popular every day, and it is just a matter of time until it becomes more widespread.
Another major change in the future will be the increasing popularity of bike lanes. Bike lanes are special pavement designs that help cyclists have more space to move around. These lanes are often built near busy intersections so that drivers can’t easily run into them.

Creative process: What are the four steps?
Creative process is key to any creative endeavors. There are four steps that go into creating a masterpiece: 1) Defining the problem or goal. This will help you come up with a strong plan of how you will solve the problem, 2) Crafting the solution or idea. This can be done through brainstorming, exploring different options, and formulating a proposal. 3) Testing and refining the solution or idea. This can involve working on it for hours, weekends, or even weeks until it’s ready for submission to an audience. 4) Sending the solution or idea off to be created by others. Once it’s created by someone else, it needs to be edited, improved upon, and finalized before being published online or as a final product.
