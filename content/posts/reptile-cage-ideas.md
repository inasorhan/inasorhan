Outdoor projects: How to fix a broken window, install a new deck, or repaint your house.
If you're looking to fix a broken window or install a new deck, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some easy diy projects to get started:
1. Fix a Broken Window

One way to fix a broken window is to use your hands. Get some adhesive and put it on the inside of the windowpane. Once it's set, hold onto the edge of the adhesive and pull the window open. You could also use screws if the window frame is strong enough to hold itself together without help. If all of this doesn't work, call a professional!

2. Install a New Deck or Decking

Another option for fixing a broken window is to install new decking or railing. This can be done either in-home or at an outdoor location.

Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started:
