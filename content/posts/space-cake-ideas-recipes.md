What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.

How to create a positive customer experience
Creating a positive customer experience is not only important for your business, but also for your own personal satisfaction. Here are some tips to help make your customer experience more positive:
1. Keep your customers close by. When possible, keep your customers close to you and give them personalized service. This will create a feeling of warmth and connection with you, which will make them want to come back.

2. Be patient. Don't take things too quickly or you'll lose the trust of your customers. Instead, work slowly and steadily to build up a relationship with them. This will give you time to understand them and learn their needs.

3. Make sure you're listening attentively. Not only do it show that you care about what they have to say, but it can also help improve the quality of conversations when trying to sell something or provide support.

Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.
