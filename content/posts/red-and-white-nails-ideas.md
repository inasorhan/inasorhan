The Future of Work: How will work change in the future?
According to many experts, the future of work is one in which employees are able to work from home, commute less, and enjoy other forms of leisure. While these changes may sound like good news for workers, they also present some challenges. For example, if people are able to work from home while they have children or elderly parents around, this can lead to tension and stress at home. Additionally, working from home can also lead to a lack of social interaction and communication with coworkers. These concerns make it difficult for companies to determine if the benefits of using remote working platforms outweigh the potential drawbacks. In order to figure out the future of work, companies will need to consider not only the benefits but also the risks.

What is brainstroming?
Are you feeling overwhelmed and lost? If so, you may be experiencing brainstroming. Brainstroming is a phenomena that occurs when one is overwhelmed and cannot think of anything to focus on. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and confusion. There are a few things that can help to improve your mental state while suffering from brainstroming. First, try focusing on why you are feeling overwhelmed. This could be as simple as identifying a specific task that you need to complete in order to feel better, or thinking about what others have said or done that has made you feel this way. Additionally, break down the task into smaller goals rather than trying to do the entire thing at once. Doing small tasks multiple times throughout the day will help keep your mind off of the larger issues at hand and will make it easier to stay focused on your goals.
