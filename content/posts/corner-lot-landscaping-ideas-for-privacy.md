What is the best way to organize your home?
There are many ways to organize a home, but one of the most popular and simple methods is to create a system where each room has its own individual category. This can help you focus on your career or other important responsibilities while still having plenty of space to relax and use your home as you please. Here are five tips on how to make this system work for you: 1) Create categories for bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, family areas, and other areas in your home. This will help you easier find what you need when it comes time to move or rearrange things. 2) Label each category with a relevant keyword or phrase. For example, if you have bedroom categories that include beds, walls, and chests of drawers, then they would be labeled Bedrooms, Walls, Drawers etc.

This has the potential to create a massive workforce shift, with many jobs that are currently considered low-skill or manual labor becoming high-skill or computer-assisted tasks.
