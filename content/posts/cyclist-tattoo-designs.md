Ideas for Art and Design: What are some possibilities?
Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.
