Innovation: How can you make your inventions more successful?
Inventions can be a great way to make your business more successful. By coming up with new ways to do things, you can make your products or services more affordable and accessible, or even create new markets for them. Here are four tips for making your inventions more successful:
1. Think about what customers want. When you come up with an invention, think about the needs that your target market might have. What are the products or services that you could offer that would meet those needs?
