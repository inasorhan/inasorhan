Origins of creativity: The origin of creative thought is unknown, but it likely has something to do with mental stimulation and the need for novelty.
There is debate over the origins of creativity, but there is no doubt that it has something to do with mental stimulation and the need for novelty. While scientists are still working to unlock the secrets of creativity, it is likely that its origins lie in some form of mental stimulation. This can be found in things like reading, art, and music.

Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.
