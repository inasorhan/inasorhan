The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things youâ€™re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readersâ€™ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?

Types of Invention
Inventions can be classified into three types: physical, chemical, and biological. Physical inventions include things like new pieces of technology or products. Chemical inventions involve adding new elements to the environment or making it more difficult for something to grow. Biological inventions involve creating a way to create life or solving a mystery.

Origin of Invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that was not originally planned or conceived by someone else. It can be anything from building a new computer to creating a new type of sauce. Inventions have been around for centuries, but their origins are still unknown. One possible explanation for the birth of invention is that somebody came up with the idea in their head and then put it into practice. Another theory suggests that somebody else helped develop the original idea before it was put into action. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question â€“ each personâ€™s experience and knowledge will likely differ on how they came up with the original product or idea.
