Invention has the potential to change how people live and work. The ability to make something new and improve upon an old idea can be a powerful force for good. For example, imagine if you could design a better way to cook food. This would not only save time and money, but it would also help ensure that everyone had access to quality food. Similarly, imagine if you could create a better way to type text or make email replies. These are just a few examples of what inventions could do for society.
