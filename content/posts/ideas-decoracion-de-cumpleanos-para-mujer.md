Patenting an invention: How do you do it?
Patenting an invention is a common process used by businesses to protect their ideas and protect them from others who may want to use them without permission. There are several ways to do this, and the most important part is to find the right method for you and your business. Inventors should also be careful when patenting their ideas as they could face infringement lawsuits if someone else uses them without giving credit or sharing in profits.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.
