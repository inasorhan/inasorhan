The Process of Finding New Ideas: How do you go about finding them?
There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the process of finding new ideas can vary depending on the individual. However, here are a few tips to help you get started: 
1. Take some time to analyze your current work and see what ideas come to mind. This will help you develop a better understanding of what you could potentially improve or create in the future. 
2. Look for competitions and events that might be relevant to your field or industry. By participating in these events, you'll be able to network with other professionals and learn from their experiences. 
3. focused on solving real world problems rather than simply thinking up new concepts or ideas. If you're not working on actual projects, it's hard to generate new ideas for clients or customers.
