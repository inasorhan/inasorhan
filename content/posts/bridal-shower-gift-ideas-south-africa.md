The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.

The New Workplace: What are the new trends in work?
The new workplace is a place where employees can be their best selves. There are many different ideas for the new workplace, but some of the most popular ones include:
1. In-person meetings: Company executives and managers now often hold face-to-face meetings to discuss important business issues. This allows employees to have a more direct conversation with their superiors.

2. Virtual work environments: Employees can now work from home or from any location in the world. This allows companies to save on office space and time.

3. Online applications: Companies are increasingly using online applications to connect with potential employees. This makes it easier for companies to find qualified workers and eliminates the need for physical interviews.
