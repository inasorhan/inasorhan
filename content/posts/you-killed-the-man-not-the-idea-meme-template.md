How do you make your blog stand out from the rest?
There are a few things you can do to make your blog stand out from the rest. Here are some ideas: 
1. Use a unique tagline. This will help people know where they can find your blog, and it will also help you attract more traffic.

2. Make your blog content interesting and helpful. People want to read helpful, informative posts, not just those that are empty calories or boring information dumps.

3. Be funny and entertaining. Blogging is a fun hobby, so make sure your content is both enjoyable and informative too!

4. Be original. When other bloggers start using the same template or style for their blogs, it becomes difficult for them to stand out from the crowd. So be unique and think outside the box!
