Summary: What are some things to remember when trying to be creative?
Creativity is a good thing, but it doesn't mean you have to be creative all the time. There are some things you can do to help make your creativity more effective. Here are some tips:
1. Try to find a subject that you feel passionate about. This will help get your creative juices flowing and give you ideas for projects that are specifically tailored to that subject matter.

2. experiment with different mediums and techniques. Don't be afraid to try new things, even if they don't work out immediately. You'll get better at creating with variety in mind.

3. make time for yourself each day. If you're not able to create during your normal hours, invest in time tomorrow that will allow you to be creative at night or during other times when you're free from distractions.
