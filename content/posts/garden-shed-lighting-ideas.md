Cut down on expenses: How do you save money on your everyday items?
When it comes to spending money, most people tend to do things the same way over and over again. That is, they try to save money by doing everything they can. However, if you want to save money on your everyday items, there are a few ways you can do this. One way is to cut down on your expenses by making small changes in your behavior. For example, rather than spending $5 on a movie ticket every time you go out with friends, spend $3 or $2 instead. Another way of saving money is by shopping at thrift stores or sale areas. There are usually sales going on all the time at these places so you can get good deals on your everyday items.

The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.
