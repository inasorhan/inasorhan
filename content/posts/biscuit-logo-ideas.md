Why do we need ideas?
Think about the last time you came up with an idea. How did it feel? Did everything click into place and do what you wanted? If not, why not?
Ideas are essential to our success. Without them, we would be at a disadvantage in any field we choose to pursue. However, they can also be frustrating and time-consuming to come up with. So how do we make sure that our ideas turn into successful projects? Here are a few tips: 

1) Make sure your ideas are grounded in reality 
Ideas should only be based on what you've seen or experienced before. Otherwise, they will likely be scrapped before they even get started. 
2) Be organized and structured 
Ideas need to be broken down into specific steps and goals so that they can be completed quickly and easily.
