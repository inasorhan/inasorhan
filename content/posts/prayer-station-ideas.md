Innovation: How do you create new products or services?
Invention ideas are something that can be created by anyone, and the process of coming up with them is often a collaborative effort. There are a variety of ways to come up with new products and services, but the best way to create something original is to think outside the box. Here are four tips for coming up with innovation ideas:
1. Be open to change: One of the most important things you can do when creating new products or services is to be flexible. If you’re not sure what you want your product or service to accomplish, be willing to experiment and see where things take you.

2. Be persistent: When it comes time to come up with new ideas, don’t give up easily. Keep looking for ways to improve your product or service until you find a way that works better than what you have currently in place.
