Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are better than those currently available. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think of it is as the change in direction of a product or service over time. Innovation can come from a company owner who decides to bring a new idea to market, as well as from employees who come up with new ways to do things that improve productivity or customer satisfaction.

Creative ideas come from all over, but some of the most popular ones come from thought. Some people might say that great ideas come from a brainstorming session or being in a creative mode, but for some it's just thinking about something. Whether you're brainstorming a new product idea or coming up with a plan to save your company, it's important to have good thoughts in mind when coming up with new solutions.

Choosing the right location for your small business
Small businesses are vital to our economy and society, but they can be difficult to manage on a budget. Here are some tips for choosing the best location for your small business. 
1. Consider your business size: A small business needs a space that is large enough to accommodate all of its employees and equipment, but not so large that it becomes difficult to operate. 
2. Consider your location: Your business should be located in a city or town that has a plentiful population and infrastructure, as well as good cultural amenities. 
3. Consider your expenses: You may want to consider the cost of living in your area before making a decision about where to set up shop. 
4.Consider the climate: If you plan on operating in cold or hot climates, make sure you have appropriate insurance and planning for cooling off times when necessary.
