Patenting an invention: How do you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of filing a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application can be filed in many different forms, but it is most commonly filed as a “patent application.”
When you file your patent application, you will need to provide a detailed description of your invention. This description will need to include everything from your name and contact information to the inventions that you are claiming. You will also need to provide enough evidence to support your claims.

Once you have submitted your patent application, the USPTO will review it and make any decisions necessary for approval. Once the USPTO approves your patent, you will then have to receive permission from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to sell or offer for sale your invention.
