What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get things done. Whether you have them all ready-made or you come up with them on your own, having ideas will help make your work more efficient and effective. Here are three benefits of having ideas: 
1. You’ll be able to come up with new solutions to problems faster. If you don’t have any ideas, you’ll likely spend hours looking for the same old solutions, which won’t get the job done. Having a few good ideas will provide you with a better understanding of how the problem could be solved and a way to go about solving it quickly. 
2. You’ll be able to take what you know and put it into practice.
