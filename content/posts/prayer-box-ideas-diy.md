Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.
