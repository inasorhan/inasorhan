The four types of creativity
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept that can be broken down into four main categories: visual, auditory, nonverbal, and cognitive. Each type of creativity has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Visual creativity is largely based on the ability to see things in a different way. This can be done through creative thought or observation, or by using one's imagination. Visual artists often use color to create unique designs or patterns.

Audio creativity involves creating sounds that are unique and appealing. This can be done through vocals, keyboards, guitars, or drums. Audio artists often use sound effects or rhythms to add interest and excitement to their work.

Nonverbal creativity occurs when people communicate their ideas through body language and facial expressions. Nonverbal artists often use eye contact, gestures, and vocal techniques to express their ideas.
