Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.

Invention ideas are something that can be created by anyone, and the process of coming up with them is often a collaborative effort. There are a variety of ways to come up with new products and services, but the best way to create something original is to think outside the box. Here are four tips for coming up with innovation ideas:
1. Be open to change: One of the most important things you can do when creating new products or services is to be flexible. If you’re not sure what you want your product or service to accomplish, be willing to experiment and see where things take you.

2. Be persistent: When it comes time to come up with new ideas, don’t give up easily. Keep looking for ways to improve your product or service until you find a way that works better than what you have currently in place.
