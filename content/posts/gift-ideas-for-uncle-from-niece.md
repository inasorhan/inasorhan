The definition of creative art and how it has no limits
Creative art has no definitive answer or meaning. It is art that is created from the imagination, emotions, and thoughts of an artist. It can be anything that the artist wants it to be, and there are no limits on what can be considered creative art.
Some people may say that creative art is only valid if it is created with a certain purpose or meaning in mind, but that is not the case. The beauty of creative art is that it can be whatever the artist wants it to be, and there are no rules or boundaries that need to be followed.

The sky's the limit when it comes to creative art, and that's what makes it so special. Anyone can create something beautiful and unique, regardless of their skill level or experience.

How can we develop big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, anyone can have them. It's just a matter of coming up with a plan and executing it. Here are four tips that can help you get started:
1. Definition: What is your idea?

 defines your idea in the most concise way possible, which will give you more room to work on it without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've nailed down what your idea is, make sure that everyone who will need to hear it (including yourself) agrees on its importance. This will ensure that the idea has enough power to carry out its potential.

2. Execution: How are you going to execute your idea?

This is where things get tricky. If your plan isn't well- thought-out or if you don't have enough manpower or resources at your disposal, your idea won't be able to take off.
