How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.
