Ideas can be classified by how they are approached. There are three main types of ideas: problem, solution, and goal. Problem ideas come up with a unique solution that solves the problem at hand. Solution ideas come up with a new way of doing something that solves the problem, but may not be what was originally proposed. Goal ideas are the final solution to a problem or goal. They come up with a specific plan or destination that is aimed at getting somewhere else.
