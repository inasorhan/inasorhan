How does innovation help businesses succeed?
Businesses that are able to innovate and embrace change are able to grow their businesses faster and achieve success. Innovation can be done in a number of ways, but some of the most common methods include:
1. Bringing in new ideas – whether it’s from outside of the company or from within itself. This can help businesses see new possibilities and come up with innovative ways to improve their products or services.

2. Applying cutting-edge technology – again, whether it’s from outside of the company or from within themselves. With technology becoming more and more complex every day, innovation is key in being able to keep up with the changing trends.

3. Updating old methods – again, this could come from outside of the company or inside themselves if they’re using outdated processes or tools.

Idea generation: What makes some ideas more creative than others?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more creative than others, but there are some general principles that apply to all creative ideas.
One principle is that ideas should be original. Ideas that are based on other people's work or experience can be less creative because they're recycled or copied from other sources.

Another principle is that ideas should be fresh. Ideas that have been around for a while can become stale and unoriginal. Fresh ideas are always more innovative and exciting to think about.
