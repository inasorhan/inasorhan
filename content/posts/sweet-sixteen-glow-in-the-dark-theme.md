Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.

Invention 4: a new way to produce energy from renewable resources
Invention ideas can produce energy from renewable resources in a variety of ways, some more efficient than others. One such idea is to create turbines that turn renewable energy into electricity. This could be useful for homes and businesses that do not have access to traditional power sources, or for those who are trying to save money on their energy bill. Another innovation is the use of solar panels to generate energy. These panels can be placed on roofs or in other locations where sunlight shines down on them, and they can also be used to generate power when the sun is not shining.
