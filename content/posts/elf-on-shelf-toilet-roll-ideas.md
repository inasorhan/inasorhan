How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

Invention ideas can be as simple as a new product or as complex as a new way to do an old thing. Whatever the invention, there are a few things that must be true in order for it to be called an invention. First, the invention must be novel and not already in use. Second, the invention must be useful, and third, the innovation must improve upon an existing product or method.
