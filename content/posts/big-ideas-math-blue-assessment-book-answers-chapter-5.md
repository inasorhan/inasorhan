The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.

Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.
