Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

Conclusion: Why should businesses invest in innovation?
Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve and stay competitive. Innovation can be found in anything from technology to marketing. However, businesses that are Continuously Innovation-Minded will see a return on investment (ROI) much sooner than those that aren’t. To be continuously innovative, businesses must have a clear idea of what they want to create and then make sure they can actually achieve it. This requires significant resources and time, but with the right attitude and strategies, businesses can reap the rewards of innovation sooner rather than later.
