How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.

Definition of creativity: What is needed to be creative?
Creativity is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different aspects of life. In the modern world, creativity is often described as the ability to come up with new ideas or concepts. It can be used in different ways, but generally it refers to the act of coming up with something new. There are many definitions of creativity, but one that is most commonly used is the definition given by Julius Caesar: Creatio est ad astrae bonum. This means “ creatio (creation) is good for getting ahead in life.” The definition also includes the idea that creativity is a mental state that can be found when people are working on their own and are not influenced by anyone else.

Definition of creativity: Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems.
Creativity is a relative term. Some people may define it as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems, while others may see creativity as the ability to be innovative and daring. Whether someone believes in creativity or not is largely subjective. However, what we can say with certainty is that creativity is an essential part of any creative person’s arsenal. without creativity, there would be no innovation or new ideas to share with the world.
