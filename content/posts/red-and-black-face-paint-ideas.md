What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been available before. Innovation can happen in any industry, but it is most commonly found in the technology and business sectors. There are a number of different ways to achieve innovation, but one of the most common methods is through trial and error. This means that early adopters of a new product or service test and experiment with it to see if it works before launching it into the market. In order to be successful, innovation needs to be based on a strong idea, good product design, and efficient execution.
