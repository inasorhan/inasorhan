The Creative Process: How does creativity happen?
Creativity is an unpredictable process that often occurs during the creative process. It can be considered a type of improvisation, which is where ideas and thoughts come together without pre-determined plans or expectations. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: ideation, creation, and Implementation. Ideation is when something new and unheard of comes to mind, while creation is when it is put into a realistic form through creativity and collaboration.

Conclusion: Some tips for staying creative.
Creativity is key to a successful life. With the right tools, creativity can be unleashed to achieve anything you set your mind to. Here are a few tips to help you stay creative: 1. Take time for yourself – if you don’t have time for creativity, it won’t flow out of you. Slow down and allow yourself some time for yourself so that you can come back with fresh ideas. 2. Get organized – once you have an idea, try to organize it so that it feels like a project instead of something that just needs to be done. This will help keep your brain active and focused on the task at hand. 3. Be open to feedback – negative or positive feedback will help you develop new ideas and come up with new ways of thinking about things.

Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.
