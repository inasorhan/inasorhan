What is innovation and how does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is a term that has been used for different things in different times. It can be considered to be two different concepts, although they have many similarities. Innovation can be defined as the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. This solution can be something that was previously thought impossible or something that was not even considered possible before. Innovation is also often described as being different from other forms of creativity, which is what this article will focus on. Other forms of creativity may involve coming up with ideas or solutions that are not practical or feasible. Innovation, on the other hand, involves coming up with a new and innovative solution to a problem that people have never seen before.

The history of creative art: How does it start?
Creative art has a long and complex history, with different people and cultures contributing to its creation. One of the earliest examples of creative art was considered to be cave art, which was discovered in France in the late 1800s. This type of art involved artists creating pieces out of natural materials such as flint and obsidian. It is thought that these artists used their creativity to escape from reality and explore their inner world. From there, other forms of creative art began to emerge, including sculpture and painting. While both types of art have their own unique strengths, they are united by the fact that they are created using inspiration and ideas from outside of the artist’s own experience.
