Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself.

2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.
