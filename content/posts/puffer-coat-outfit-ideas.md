Conclusion: Why should we be worried about the future of innovation?
Innovation is one of the most important forces that drive economic growth and public satisfaction.

Some of these include technological unemployment, global warming, and financial instability. If these issues continue to grow in severity, they could lead to significant reductions in innovation and public satisfaction. This could ultimately lead to declines in economic growth and social stability.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for business?
Creativity is key to businesses. Without creativity, businesses couldn't exist. However, what does it mean for business? 
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. This can be done through brainstorming, creative thinking, or simply coming up with different options and concepts. 

However, creativity also has to be used wisely. Too much creativity can lead to a lack of focus and productivity in a business. And too little creativity can also lead to boredom or stagnation. 

So while creativity is key to businesses, it's also important that businesses use it in a responsible manner. Otherwise, they could get left behind in the competitive race for innovation.
