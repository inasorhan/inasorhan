What are the benefits of creativity?
Creativity is a key component of success in any business or professional setting. The ability to come up with new and innovative ideas is a valuable asset, which can help you achieve your goals. There are many benefits to creativity, including improved communication and problem-solving skills, as well as more efficient and effective workflows. Here are four ways creativity can benefit your business: 
1) By broadening your perspective – when you take on new challenges, you often come up with new solutions that aren’t possible before. This opens up opportunities for innovation and growth; 
2) By developing new strategies – if you can find ways to improve on what others are doing, your business will be more successful. This can include coming up with novel ideas for marketing or sales campaigns, or finding creative ways to make products or services more attractive to customers.
