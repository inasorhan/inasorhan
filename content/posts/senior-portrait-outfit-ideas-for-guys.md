Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times itâ€™s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.

Futures of technology
What do you think the future holds for technology? Some believe that it will continue to evolve and grow, while others predict that it will become more advanced and complex. Either way, there are a number of ideas that could be explored in order to further advance this field. Here are some possible scenarios:
1) In 2022, we may see advances in 3D printing technology that allow for objects to be created from multiple layers of plastic or other materials. This would allow for a significant increase in the number of products that can be manufactured on a large scale, as well as faster and easier production times.

2) Another development that could impact our industry is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). As machines get better at learning and responding to various challenges, they may become capable of performing tasks that were once considered impossible or too difficult for humans to perform.
