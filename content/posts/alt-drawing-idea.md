The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be any thing you want them to be. Whether it's coming up with new ways of doing something, or coming up with new ways of thinking about things, there are always some great creative ideas out there. Here are a few examples: 
1. Ideas for using the environment around you to your advantage. When you're outside, try to think of ways to use the environment around you to your advantage. For example, if you're at a park, think of ways to make the park more fun by adding activities such as playgrounds and adventure gardens. 

2. Coming up with new ways of advertising. One way to get people's attention is to come up with new ads that are different from what they've seen before.

Creativity and professionalism: How do you use creativity in your job?
Creativity and professionalism are two important aspects of any job. If you want to be a successful artist, you need to be able to come up with creative ideas. If you want to be a professional doctor, you also need to be able to come up with innovative ways to help patients. In both cases, creativity and professionalism are essential.
If you want your work to look professional, you need to use creativity as often as possible. For example, when brainstorming new ideas for a product or company, always include some creative ideas in your mind. Even if they’re not exactly what you’re thinking of right now, working on some creative projects will help make your work look more polished and professional.

Ultimately, being creative and professional is important in any career.
