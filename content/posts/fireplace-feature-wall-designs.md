Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but there’s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, it’s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.

What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.
