The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.

What is creative art and why should you care?
Creative art is a form of art that uses imagination and creativity to create something new. By definition, creative art is any art that is created using the power of imagination and creativity. There are many types of creative art, including photography, painting, poetry, sculpture, and music. Each artist creates their own unique brand of creative art.

This can be very rewarding because it allows them to explore their repertoire of skills in a way that they may not have been able to do with other forms of artistic expression. Second, creative artists often experiment with ideas and techniques that other artists might not consider. This can lead to interesting outcomes that you might not have found if you were just looking for traditional Approaches to Art.
