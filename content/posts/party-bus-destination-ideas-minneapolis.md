How can we bring these ideas to life?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They give a direction, a potential solution, and a reason to keep going. By coming up with big ideas, you can inspire your team and yourself to continue trying new things even when things feel threatening or difficult. Here are eight ways to bring big ideas to life:
1. Come up with an idea that’s outside the box: There’s no shame in being original, but many startups focus on what others are doing instead of coming up with their own concepts or solutions. If you don’t have anything similar in mind, you can always consider using popular trends or phrases as your starting point.

2. Take on a challenge: When it comes time to come up with a concept or solution, sometimes challenges are what help foster creativity and innovation.

Ethics and innovation: What ethical considerations should be made when developing new technology?

For example, how do we ensure that our inventions are safe and effective? What happens to data after we release our ideas? Are we responsible for the negative consequences of our innovations? And most importantly, what is the right thing to do in a situation where someone chooses to use our invention?

What are its benefits?
A study by Dr. David Levy and colleagues at the University of Montreal has shown that brainstroming can improve creativity. The effect is even stronger when participants are working on a problem that they are really passionate about. Brainstroming allows people to focus on one task for a sustained period of time, making them more creative in their thoughts and ideas.
