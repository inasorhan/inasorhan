Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

The definition of art: Who makes it and what does it represent?
Creative art is a term that has been bandied about for a long time, with no one really having a clear definition of what it actually means. In many cases, it seems to be subjective and up to the artist themselves what constitutes as creative art. However, in spite of its nebulous nature, there are some key factors that seem to be essential to the definition of creative art. These include the artists' own personal vision and feelings towards their work, as well as the medium or technique used. Whether it's painting or sculpture, music or photography - any form of creative art can be said to have its own unique meaning and personality.
