Trends in technology: How will it change the way we live and work?
In 2022, we will see a shift in technology that will change the way we live and work. Key words are: ideas, 2d printing, 3d printing, artificial intelligence, blockchain. 
2d printing technology is growing in popularity. It allows users to create objects using a printer that is similar to a standard kitchen printer. This makes it easier for people to produce large numbers of objects quickly and at low cost.
