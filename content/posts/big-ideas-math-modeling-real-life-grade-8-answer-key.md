the nature of innovation and how it leads to change
Innovation is a central part of the puzzle that leads to change. It’s a process of taking something that’s working well and making it better. Innovation can be seen in everything from products to services to business models. But what makes innovation work is often more difficult than people think. Here are four examples of how innovation can lead to big changes in our world.
1) New technologies lead to new ways of doing things. When you introduce a new technology into an industry, you may see companies come up with new ways of doing things such as creating digital products or services that are easier and faster to use than ever before. This can change the way customers approach their businesses, and it can also lead to new markets for products and services.

2) Innovative business models help companies find new ways to make money.
