What are some creative ideas for businesses?
Creative ideas for businesses can be anything from a new way to market your product or service, to a new idea for how you can improve your business. Whatever the creative idea, there are some things you can do to make it work. Here are some tips: 
1. Make sure your creative ideas are realistic. Don‚Äôt try to come up with something that might not be possible or will not work in the real world. When you‚Äôre creating your ideas, think about what could really happen and how they could benefit your business. 
2. Get feedback before starting anything. Before starting any creative project, get input from people who know what they‚Äôre talking about and have experience with the type of product or service you‚Äôre thinking of marketing.

Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?
