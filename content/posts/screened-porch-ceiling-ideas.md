Setting up and running your own blog can be a daunting task, but with some thoughtful planning and execution it can be a rewarding experience. Here are three tips to help you get started:
1. Choose the right platform: Whether you want to run your blog on your computer or on a phone, make sure the platform is compatiable with your style and content. If you want to create an online presence for your business, choose a web-based platform such as WordPress or Tumblr. If you’re setting up a print edition, consider using e-book readers like Apple’s Kindle or Sony’s Nook.

The 5 Types of Ideas: Creative, Strategic, Normative, Primal, and Vague.
Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.
