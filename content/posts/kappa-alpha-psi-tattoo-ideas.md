There are three things to remember when creating big ideas: 1) be creative; 2) be able to see the big picture; and 3) have patience. But with these concepts in mind, there's no need to be afraid to come up with daring new ideas.

Creative ideas can be anything, but they all have to start with a cause. Sometimes all you need is an inspiration and a new perspective to see your idea from a different angle. When you have any creative ideas, take some time to brainstorm them over with friends or family. Once you have some good ideas, it's time to get started on creating your own unique project.

How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs. This will help you determine which problems might be best solved by creating a new product or service, or by improving an existing one.

2. Consider who your target market is.

What Causes Innovation?
Innovation can be explained in a few ways. One way is to say that innovation comes from change. Another way to think about it is that innovation happens when something new and different comes along and helps someone or something do what they were supposed to do but didn't actually do it. 
One of the biggest reasons for innovation is often because someone needs a new product or service to solve a problem that they didn't previously have. Innovation also happens when people come up with new ways of doing things, or coming up with new ways to make things better.
