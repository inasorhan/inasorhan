Why do we need innovation?
Innovation is key to sustaining economic growth and ensuring that society can meet the needs of its citizens. Innovation has been touted as a way to improve efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, create new products or services, and secure new markets. But what are the benefits of innovation specifically? And how do we get there?
There are a number of reasons why innovation is so important. First, it allows businesses to experiment with new methods and concepts, which can lead to increased efficiency and innovation. Second, innovation can help businesses address specific customer needs or wants that may not have been possible before. For example, by creating a product that appeals to a specific demographic or by developing an innovative marketing strategy. Finally, innovations can help businesses expand their reach into new markets or sectors- this could lead to increased profits and more customers.

The Birth of Invention: What inspired someone to think of a new way to do something
Invention is the birth of a new idea or method. Sometimes this is something as simple as coming up with a new way to do something, but sometimes it's more complex. For example, after centuries of working on Alchemy, scientists finally came up with a way to make gold in the 1500s. This was an invention, and it helped change the world.
