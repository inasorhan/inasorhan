The process of creating creative art: how does it work?
Creative art is a process that involves many different steps and tools. It can be difficult to know how it all works, but here are some tips to help get started. 
 begins with the creation of an idea. This can be anything from a simple thought to a complex plan. Next, the artist must work on this idea until it feels right. They may need to research the subject or use inspiration from other artists. Once they have something they’re happy with, they start working on the details. Here, they may use many different tools, including sketches, paintings, or sculptures. Once they’re finished, they need to make sure their work is looking good and consistent. This is usually done by testing it out on people or animals before finally giving it away to someone who will appreciate it.
