Causes and Effects of Innovation: Why do people innovate?
Innovation is a natural process that is necessary for businesses to succeed. It allows companies to come up with new ideas and products that can compete in the market. Innovation also benefits society as a whole by creating new technologies and innovations that make life easier for people. There are many reasons why innovation happens, but one of the most important reasons is for the business benefit. In order for a company to be successful, it needs to have innovative products and services that can appeal to customers. However, there are also negative effects of innovation that can impact businesses and society as a whole. There are several reasons why this might happen, but one of the most common is when businesses try to change the status quo by introducing new products or services that are not popular yet. In doing so, they risk disrupting the established order in their industry or putting their competitors at a disadvantage.

The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.
