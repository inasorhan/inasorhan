The consequences of having big ideas?
Many people believe that having big ideas is essential to creativity and innovation. However, the consequences of having big ideas can be very costly and time-consuming. For example, a company may spend years developing a new product but if its idea is not accepted by the market, the company may lose its revenue and potential customers. Additionally, it can be difficult to find backers for big projects and even harder to get the word out about them. When a company has a large idea, it can often become overshadowed by other more pressing challenges.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get things done. Whether you have them all ready-made or you come up with them on your own, having ideas will help make your work more efficient and effective. Here are three benefits of having ideas: 
1. You’ll be able to come up with new solutions to problems faster. If you don’t have any ideas, you’ll likely spend hours looking for the same old solutions, which won’t get the job done. Having a few good ideas will provide you with a better understanding of how the problem could be solved and a way to go about solving it quickly. 
2. You’ll be able to take what you know and put it into practice.

Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas, is an essential part of any skill set. It’s what allows people to create things that no one else could think of and make them their own. Different creativity techniques can be used in order to achieve different goals.
Some common creative art forms include painting, sculpture, poetry, music and advertising. Each has its own unique way of expression and can be used to communicate a message or tell a story. Some artists are even known for their completely original pieces that may not be found elsewhere.
