Idea 3: We need to be more open about our values
The world is constantly changing, and so too are the ways that people value and hold onto certain values. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be more open about our own values.
One way to do this is by sharing our thoughts with others. Another way is by writing down what we believe and why it matters to us. Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with someone who understands our values in order for us to start writing them down ourselves.

Ultimately, we need to be more conscious about how we value the things that matter most to us in order to stay ahead of the curve and stay true to our own values.

Conclusion: Creative Thinking Tips for You
Creative thinking can help you come up with unique and innovative ideas. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Keep your ideas open-ended – don’t have everything mapped out in your head before you start brainstorming. Be flexible and allow yourself to change and evolve your ideas as you think of more.

2. If you want to be really successful at creative thinking, keep things simple and achievable. Try not to overthink things or try to come up with too many solutions at once – just focus on the problem at hand and see where it leads.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no limit to what you can achieve when you take risks and try new methods.
