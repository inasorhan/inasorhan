The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.
