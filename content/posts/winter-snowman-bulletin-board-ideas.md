Origins of invention: How did people come up with ideas for new things?
The origins of many inventions can be traced back to the dawn of human civilization. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Eratosthenes in 384 BC. Other inventions that have had a lasting impact include the printing press and television. 
One of the most important factors in the development of invention is creativity. People are often inspired to come up with new ideas when they see something that they want to change or improve upon.
