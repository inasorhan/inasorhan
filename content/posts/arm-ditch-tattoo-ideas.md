Conclusion: the importance of invention
Invention is the key to progress. It is the engine of change. It drives economies and creates new industries.
Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones. This increased efficiency can lead to improved quality of life for individuals and societies as a whole.

Invention is also important because it drives economies. Economies are systems of production and exchange that provide people with the means to support themselves and their families. They are powered by human labor, which in turn is driven by motivation and ideas. Ideas come from invention.

The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.
