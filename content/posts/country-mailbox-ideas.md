How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that involves the use of imagination and creativity. It is important to note that creativity does not work in a straight line, but rather it is constantly evolving. This means that it can change and develop over time. Creative art often contains elements of the Unknown or the inexplicable, which allows for the viewer to interact with the artwork in a different way than if it were just a series of instructions written down.

Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.
