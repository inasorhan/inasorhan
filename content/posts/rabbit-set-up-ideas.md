Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.

How To Come Up With Ideas: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to help something else become a reality. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea or coming up with a plan to improve something you’re working on, creativity is essential to any successful project. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 1. Take your time – Don’t try to come up with an idea right away. In most cases, it won’t be the best option, and you may not get very far without some effort. 2. Be open to new ideas – There are always going to be new ways of thinking when it comes to ideas, so don’t be afraid to experiment.
